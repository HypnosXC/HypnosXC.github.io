I am a recent graduate in [MCG GROUP](https://mcg.nju.edu.cn/) at [Nanjing University](https://cs.nju.edu.cn/main.htm/), supervised by [Prof. Limin Wang](https://wanglimin.github.io/) and just obtained my Master degree in 2024. I also obtained the B.Sc degree from [Nanjing University](https://cs.nju.edu.cn/main.htm/) in 2021, where I was fortunate to cross paths with my mentor, setting the course for my academic journey.

My academic pursuits are centered on the exciting fields of computer vision and graphics. Currently, I am particularly engrossed in the development of Generative Models and **Accelerating Diffuison Models**. I have a consistent focus on foundation Multi-modal models, with a preference for Vision-Language Models, and I am keen on advancing **Efficient and Transfer Learning methodologies** based on these models.
