I am a recent graduate in [MCG GROUP](https://mcg.nju.edu.cn/) at [Nanjing University](https://cs.nju.edu.cn/main.htm/), supervised by [Prof. Limin Wang](https://wanglimin.github.io/). I just obtained my Master degree in 2024, and I also obtained the B.Sc degree from [Nanjing University](https://cs.nju.edu.cn/main.htm/) in 2021, where I was fortunate to cross paths with my mentor, setting the course for my academic journey.

My academic pursuits are centered on the exciting fields of computer vision and graphics. Currently, I am particularly engrossed in the development of Generative Models and **Accelerating Diffuison Models**. I have a consistent focus on foundation Multi-modal models, with a preference for Vision-Language Models, and I am keen on advancing **Efficient and Transfer Learning methodologies** based on these models.

<font color=red>**NEW**: I am actively seeking Ph.D. opportunities in the upcoming 2025. If you see potential alignment with my research interests and your program, please feel free to reach out to me directly via email. I am eager to explore collaborative possibilities and continue my contributions to the field.</font>
